# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This is a project completed for Lighthouse Labs as part of the Web Development Bootcamp Program. Students were given starter code to build upon to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as Node and Express back-end skills. 

Happy Tweetering!
